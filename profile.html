    <h3>How we work and what we won't work on</h3>

    <ul class="left">
      <h2>in a nutshell, <em>lambda: resilient.systems</em>:</h2>
      <li>&mdash; prefers to work with clearly laid out requirements/specs., service level agreements, agile development</li>
      <li>&mdash; has no issues with (bilateral) non-disclosure agreements and special policies customers may require</li>
      <li>&mdash; loves F/OSS - but will also work, and develop on, and with, 'closed' technologies and environments</li>
      <li>&mdash; does not work with dubious and uncertain customers (and refuses to work with LE/FED/INT/GOV)</li>
      <li>&mdash; is very passionate about privacy and will not engage in ethically questionable research, development nor engineering projects</li>
      <li>&mdash; certainly prefers work on open (source) projects, useful to the  wider internet community (see below 'Contract Terms') but regularly works with/on- and audits propritary hardware and software and appliances</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Contract Terms and Agreement</h3>
    <div class="left">
